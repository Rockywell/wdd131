            <h2>1 Nephi 3:7</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: ‘I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them.’” This verse beautifully expresses Nephi’s unwavering faith and willingness to act when God commands—even in the face of danger. It illustrates the principle that God only asks of us what we are capable of, and He will provide the means to fulfill His commandments.</p>

            <h2>Moroni 10:20</h2>
            <p>Wherefore, there must be faith; and if there must be faith there must also be hope; and if there must be hope there must also be charity.” This passage links three essential Christian virtues—faith, hope, and charity—showing their interdependence. It reminds readers that genuine faith fosters hope, which in turn develops into charity (the pure love of Christ), emphasizing how they support one another in our spiritual journey.</p>
